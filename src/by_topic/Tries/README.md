### Trie

Searching in trie is faster without any collision. Following are some of the
sample usages:

- Insert and Find Words
- Partial Search
- Auto suggestion
- Words with common prefixes

#### Time Complexity
We can serach the key in O(M) times: M is length of the string
    
#### Space Complexity
Memory requirement of Trie is O(alphabet_size*key length*N)
where N is number of keys in Trie.
